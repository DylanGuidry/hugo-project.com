![Image](/Img/C&W.jpg)

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs

- ¼ cup heavy cream

- 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper

- 1 tablespoon salt

- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper

- 2 cups all-purpose flour

- 1 cup cornstarch

- 1 tablespoon salt

- 1 quart peanut oil for frying

- 8 chicken tenders

- 1 cup mayonnaise

- ¼ cup maple syrup

- 2 teaspoons prepared horseradish

- 1 teaspoon dry mustard powder

- 12 slices bacon

- 8 thin slices Cheddar cheese

- 8 plain frozen waffles

## Directions

**Step 1.**

Whisk together the eggs, cream, cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. In a paper bag, shake together the flour, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon salt.

**Step 2.**

Dip the chicken into the beaten egg mixture, then place into the flour mixture and shake to coat. Place the breaded chicken onto a wire rack; do not stack. Let the chicken rest for 20 minutes to allow the coating to set.

**Step 3.**

Heat about 3 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In small batches, fry chicken 5 to 8 minutes until golden brown. Remove chicken, and drain on paper towels. Set aside or keep warm in a a low oven.

**Step 4.**

Combine the mayonnaise, maple syrup, horseradish, and mustard powder in a medium bowl. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.

**Step 5.**

To assemble the sandwiches: Place 4 waffles on a cookie sheet, top each waffle with 2 chicken tenders, 3 slices of bacon, and 2 slices of Cheddar. Broil the sandwich for a 3 to 5 minutes until the cheese melts. Spread 3 tablespoons of the maple mayonnaise on the remaining 4 waffles and place on top of the sandwich.
